# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is where objects are created to give greater control of data utilzing methods. This is different then functional programming because there is less control over data sections than there is with OOP. Functional programming only allows data to be changed through the function as a whole. 

Researched answer: OOP is a software management system of sorts that allows progammers to have more control on making smalls changes without having massive effects on the whole program. OOP provides containers for data and functions that can be manipulated without affecting the program as a whole. Functional programming is almost the opposite. It centers around functions and avoids state/mutable data as in OOP. 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integar is a number and a float has a decimal in the number.

Researched answer: Integers are a whole number and a float is a number that has a decimal point. A float, or a floating-point number, in Ruby can provide more accurate values because they provide a real number (meaning rational or irrational). Whereas, integers can only be positive, negative, or 0.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:I do not know what implicit return means.

Researched answer: In Ruby, an implicit value will return the function without actually using the keyword, 'return'.

4. What is a block in Ruby? 

Your answer: A block in Ruby is a block of code, usually a method that is defined by def and end.

Researched answer: Blocks in Ruby are chunks of code that can be given a name, are enclosed in a do / end statement or {}, can have multiple arguments (which are defined between pipes ||). They keyword 'yield', will call the block and run it. 

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a value in a Ruby hash, you will need to type #{$value}

Researched answer: To extract a hash, you will need to pull the value out using its keys. This is annotated through a set of [] vs the {} used in the original hash. The key in the value will be the data that is inputed. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: 'Request specification' is used to testing the behavior of objects in Ruby. Specs are equal to the desired output of the test. RSpec is a domain specific language. It is similar to jest test where it requires a descirbe, it and expect statement buildout.

2. Test-driven development: Test-driven development is the framework for a test that development teams utilize to ensure that the code works properly. The scope of it involves checking the input and output of the function.

3. PostgreSQL: SQL stands for Stuctured Query Language. PostgreSQL is one type of SQ and is a management system that looks through databases with an OOP lens. SQL uses a domain-specific language that communicates with relational databases.

4. CRUD: An acryonym for Create, Read, Update and Delete are all actions that can be performed on data. It serves as a checklist of things that a programmer can do to manipulate data. These actions can specifically be applied to hashes in Ruby. They also need to be applied in order.

5. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol that is used for the World Wide Web. It is used to ask for information from services and other platforms that it needs to load a website. Most requests from HTTP contain a URL, HTTP version type, HTTP request headers and an HTTP method.
